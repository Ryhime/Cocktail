## Goals
Create a strongly and statically typed compiled language that carries over as many ease of use options from interpreters as possible.


## How to run
### Build
<code>./Build.sh</code> - Builds and runs the project

### Run
<code>./Run.sh</code> - Runs the project

### Output
Right now outputs static files that are hard coded on how to generate. It will output HelloWorld.asm, HelloWorld.o, and a HelloWorld executable. Run <code>./HelloWorld</code> to run the executable, assuming your computer is using x86.
